# Kickstarting with Excel 

## Overview of Project
Louise launched a crowfunding campaign for a play called *Fever*. Her campaign almost achieved the fundraising goal. However, she wants to have more information about the outcome of other campaigns such as the outcomes of those projects in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
The objective of this analysis is to give Louise more information about theater campaigns outcomes based on the two aspects mentioned above. Having a big data set with information about different types of projects will help us sort the information to help Louise. 

## Analysis and Challenges
There were two analyses performed in order to achieve the purpose of this project. First, an analysis of outcomes based on launch date. The second was an analysis of outcomes based on funding goals. Nevertheless, there were certain difficulties encountered while executing the analyses. 

### Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date
First of all, in the main sheet named *Kickstarter* a column named *Years* was added to make it eassier to spot the year each campaign was launched.

Then, with all the data from the main sheet a pivot table was made. In the table the rows show the months of the launching date of each campaign and the columns exhibit wether those projects were successful, failed, or canceled. To make the analysis more precise the data was filtered to display only the information of the category *Theater*.

Finally, a pivot chart was created. In the chart the information of the table is shown. This visualization item is useful to see the data in a more organized and undestandable way. It also makes drawing conclusions about the information eassier.
